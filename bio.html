                    An innovative and socially conscious Software Developer, 
                    with robust internships at industry-leading organizations such as 
                    IBM and Motorola Solutions under my belt. My expertise lies in Python and MySQL, 
                    with a commitment to adhering to the highest standards of security and readability 
                    in my coding practices. My programming skills are further diversified by my proficiency in C/C++, CUDA, HTML, and CSS.
                    I enjoy learning new skills and adapting to any problem at hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not just passionate about crafting high-quality software solutions; 
                    I also strive to create tools that genuinely help people. I find fulfillment in 
                    knowing that my work has a meaningful impact, making a real difference in the lives 
                    of the end-users. Agile methodology is at the heart of my work, promoting efficiency, 
                    adaptability, and teamwork throughout the software development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from my professional life, I'm a staunch advocate for mental health wellness 
                    and dedicate my time to volunteer work in this field. I firmly believe that 
                    technology and empathy can, and should, go hand-in-hand. I'm always eager to use 
                    my skills to build a more inclusive and compassionate world.
